### 2) For generating some Layout XMLs quickly and spacing them out well:
- OpenAI, “ChatGPT,” chat.openai.com, 2023. https://chat.openai.com/  
* math_minigame.xml 's LinearLayout was generated but ChatGPT but modified for our use. The other two minigames use the same layout as well

### 3) For working with Countdown Timers in Kotlin
* https://medium.com/@olajhidey/working-with-countdown-timer-in-android-studio-using-kotlin-39fd7826e205
* Example:
```
equationTimer = object : CountDownTimer(MAX_GAME_TIME, GameManager.gameDelayTime) {
    override fun onTick(millisUntilFinished: Long) {
        if (!isGamePaused) {
            /*     Other Code      */
            generateEquation()
        }
    }
    override fun onFinish() {
        //Call Next Game or Game Over Screen
        GameManager.nextGame(this@MathGame)
    }
}
```

### 4) For Using Images of country flags (Open Source)
- “Flagpack,” flagpack.xyz. https://flagpack.xyz/

### 5) Animation method generated by ChatGPT:
- The following method that provides animation to our React Rumble icon image was generated by ChatGPT:-

    ```
	private fun startBounceAnimation(iconImage: ImageView) {
		// Set up the animator to scale the ImageView
		val animator = ValueAnimator.ofFloat(1f, 1.5f, 1f)
		animator.duration = 2000 // Duration of the animation in milliseconds
		animator.addUpdateListener { animation ->
			val scale = animation.animatedValue as Float
			iconImage.scaleX = scale
			iconImage.scaleY = scale
		}

		// Set the repeat count to INFINITE for continuous animation
		animator.repeatCount = ValueAnimator.INFINITE

		// Start the animator
		animator.start()
	}
    ```
